## Bold Statements - Track Predictions, And More!

## A project for WDI 45 by Aaron Horowitz

Welcome to Bold Statements! Bold Statements was created to keep track of predictions, from bets among friends, to sportscasters guessing where free agents will sign, to reporters wildly prognosticating without reputable sources. Statements are recorded and tracked, and can be verified to be true or false, with sources stored.

## Find Bold Statements on Heroku!

Bold Statements will soon be hosted at http://boldstatements.herokuapp.com
